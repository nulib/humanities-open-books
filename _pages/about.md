Northwestern Open is an online platform providing open access to previously out-of-print titles published by Northwestern University Press. With the generous support of the Humanities Open Book Program, a joint effort of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Northwestern is proud to make available important and groundbreaking works in philosophy, literary criticism, and African studies. Access to the collection is free and open to scholars and the public alike.  

“Northwestern University Press has published thousands of original and critically acclaimed books that have advanced knowledge and scholarship in a wide range of fields,” said press director Jane Bunker. “It is a pleasure to make these long unavailable titles available again. Thanks to the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, we are now able to place this scholarship in an open online environment where it is accessible to interested readers around the globe. It is a privilege to be able to fulfill our mission in this way.”

The entire collection is now available for use and download. The Press is pleased to offer high quality print-on-demand editions for readers who would like to own a physical copy of any book in Northwestern Open.
