_This Africa_ is both a literary history and a survey of the West African novel. Gleason explores seventeen novels in French and eight in English, developing a framework of literary criticism that includes the conqueror, the hero, city life, village life, and personal identity. Authors whose works are studied include Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, Mongo Beti, and Camara Layer.
