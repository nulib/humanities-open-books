In _Reason and Evidence in Husserl's Phenomenology_, David Michael Kleinberg-Levin examines Husserl's concept of necessary, a priori, and absolutely certain indubitable evidence, which he terms apodictic, and his related concept of complete evidence, which he terms adequate. To do so it explicates some of the more general relevant features of phenomenology as a whole.
