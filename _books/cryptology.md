description: "Originally published in 1945, An Historical and Analytical Bibliography of the Literature of Cryptology provides a comprehensive listing of the most important works written up to that time on cryptography, as well as works in related fields in which cryptography appears. It includes a vast range of materials: scientific and technical works dealing with military, diplomatic, and commercial uses of cryptography; popular treatments; cuneiform, runic, and other hieroglyphic writings; literary anagrams and acrostics; the symbolism of colors, gems, emblems, and insignia, and many other manifestations. Entries include descriptive and analytical annotations by the author."
