In _Southern Nilotic History_, Christopher Ehret reconstructs the history of the Southern Nilotic speaking peoples of East Africa, from their earliest origins to the beginning of the colonial period. As a history, the book is a remarkable tour de force. Using mainly linguistic evidence, the author locates populations, moves them around, determines their relative influence vis--vis their neighbors, and reconstructs aspects of their culture, from basic economy to the practice of extracting incisors. -- American Anthropologist
