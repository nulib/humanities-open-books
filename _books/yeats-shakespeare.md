<DIV>In <I>Yeats&#39;s Shakespeare,</I>&#160;the&#160;first full-length study of Yeats&rsquo;s interest in Shakespeare, Rupin W. Desai explores how Shakespearean works influenced Yeats&rsquo;s poetry and mythological drama. Exploring Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets and Yeats&rsquo;s poetry, Desai illustrates the deep degree to which Yeats identifies with Shakespeare, even to the extent of including some of Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroes in his own late poetry. Yeats&rsquo;s Shakespeare also includes an appendix that lists in detail all of Yeats&rsquo;s references to Shakespeare&rsquo;s works.</DIV>
