In _D. H. Lawrence_, Eliseo Vivas examines the aesthetic triumphs and failures of Lawrence's major works through a literary device that he coins the constitutive symbol. Understanding how Lawrence uses the constitutive symbol provides new insight into his world views. Vivas covers a wide range of Lawrence's work, including _Aaron's Rod_, _Kangaroo_, _The Plumed Serpent_, _Lady Chatterley's Lover_, _Sons and Lovers_, _The Rainbow_, and _Women in Love_. Vivas was one of the first scholars to use psychological criticism to read Lawrence's works; Vivas's and his particularly fresh reading of Lawrence's novels continue to make this a significant literary-critical study.
