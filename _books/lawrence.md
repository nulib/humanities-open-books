description: "THIS STUDY is not concerned with Lawrence the man. His life has been thoroughly examined by a large number of biographers, friendly and unfriendly; he has been psychoanalyzed, criticized, evaluated, loved in public posthumously; he has been worshipped from a distance as the lovable angel that at times he was, and he has been despised as the demon that he also was. His every move has been charted, his reading scrutinized, his formidable battles with his wife recorded, and his novels have been corrected by checking them against the facts he used as matter for them. We know he cooked, trimmed hats for Frieda, built chicken coops, baked bread in old-fashioned ovens and fell into sadistic tantrums; and we also know that he could be tender after his explosions. Sometimes the same event has been recorded by several hands—the “last supper” episode at the Café Royal, for instance."
