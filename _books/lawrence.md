description: "In D. H. Lawrence, Eliseo Vivas examines the aesthetic triumphs and failures of Lawrence's major works through a literary device that he coins the constitutive symbol. Understanding how Lawrence uses the constitutive symbol provides new insight into his world views. Vivas covers a wide range of Lawrence's work, including Aaron's Rod, Kangaroo, The Plumed Serpent, Lady Chatterley's Lover, Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, and Women in Love. Vivas was one of the first scholars to use psychological criticism to read Lawrence's works; Vivas&#39;s and his particularly fresh reading of Lawrence's novels continue to make this a significant literary-critical study."
