description: "The Epistemology of G. E. Moore is an examination of the philosophy of G. E. Moore, one of the foremost Anglo-American, analytic philosophers of the twentieth century. This book, together with Reinhardt Grossmann's Reflections on Frege's Philosophy and Moltke Gram's Kant, Ontology, and the A Priori, seeks to redress an imbalance in analytic philosophy by making a case for the relevance of analytically oriented historical studies to contemporary problems. It focuses on Moore's epistemological writings and aims to present an exhaustive overview of Moore's work on this topic."
