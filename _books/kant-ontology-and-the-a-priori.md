_Kant, Ontology, and the A Priori_ is a close study of Kant's conception of metaphysical propositions. In it Moltke Gram aims to show in what sense Kant is offering a theory of metaphysical propositions about objects in general. Gram presents a criticism of the tendency to focus on Kant's theory of dialectic as the source of paradigm cases of metaphysical propositions.
