_Thackeray: The Sentimental Cynic_ chronicles British novelist William Thackeray's ambivalent attitudes toward society and traces his conduct during the major crises of his life in terms of those attitudes. Lambert Ennis examines the emotional tensions in Thackeray's life and the impact they had in his work. In so doing, he illustrates key themes in Victorian studies more broadly: the question of manners and taste and the relationship between sentimentality and authenticity, and the ways that sentimentality might shape morality.
