description: "The kindness shown to some of my fables gives me reason to hope for the same kind of favor for this collection. Not that one of our teachers of eloquence didn’t disapprove of the decision to put them into verse. He thought that their principal adornment was to have none; further, that the constraints of poetry, along with the rigor of our language, would frequently hamper me and prevent most of these stories from having that brevity that can most justly be called the soul of tales, since without it they must drag. This opinion could come only from a man of excellent taste. I would ask him only to relax it slightly, and to judge the Lacedemonian Graces to be not so inimical to the French Muses that they couldn’t often make their way together."
