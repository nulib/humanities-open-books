description: "THIS Bibliography is the second in which AE’s books have been listed. The pioneer was the unsigned “Bibliography of AE” printed in the Dublin Magazine (Dublin) vol 5 No 1 pp 44–52 (January 1930), with its supplement in vol 10 No 4 pp 74–76 (October 1935). That was compiled by Michael Joseph MacManus (1888–September 21, 1951), literary editor of the Irish Press (Dublin) from 1934 until his death. But P. S. O’Hegarty (1879–1955) attributed that bibliography to “Seumas O’Sullivan”, in vol 22 No 3 p 60 (July 1947). MacManus’ list omitted AE’s book The Avatars.

The information in this book should prove accurate, and the compiler’s intention has been to dispel the errors and confusion of fact, biographical and bibliographical, with which AE’s reputation has been burdened. (AE was inconsistent in writing his pseudonym. Sometimes he wrote the diphthong, sometimes inserted stops.)

Some problems have proved insoluble. Zealous binders have sometimes guillotined tall pamphlets. Bound-in with other pamphlets, those by AE often seem to contradict the accurate measurements given in this book. Such binding cuts booksellers’ prices, too."
