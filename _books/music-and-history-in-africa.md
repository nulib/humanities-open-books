description: "The precolonial history of Africa was neglected for a long time, largely because the scarcity of written documents was deeply frustrating. But things have changed for the historian; a clear indication of a new interest was the establishment of the Journal of African History in 1960. New data were published, new methods led to new insights, and the frustration lost much of its sharpness. But can this also be said about the history of music in Africa? The contributors to this volume have applied themselves to this question. The only common understanding among them of their task was that they would search for musical evidence side by side with archaeological, historical, and similar material; they would correlate these wherever possible; and, in general, they would explore how music and history can mutually define and illuminate each other."
