_Critical Prefaces of the French Renaissance_ contains nearly 30 prefaces from the works of French poets and dramatists published from 1525 to 1611. Bernard Weinberg's helpful book collects prefaces from the works of satirical poets, as well as dramatists, and provides a short introduction to each preface setting it in its literary and historical context. Lyrical and satirical poets represented vary from Marot to Du Bellay to Ronsard. Dramatists represented include Jean de la Tille and Larivey, among others. The larger introduction to the volume provides literary analysis of five longer texts by Sebillet, Du Bellay, Peletier du Mans, the obscure Pierre De-laudun, and Horace. Weinberg's study brings attention back to these primary writings that are crucial for an understanding of the period.
