description: "MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT LAUGHING, little about crying. The theme laughing and crying is among the exceptions. This asymmetrical division of interests in an obviously symmetrical association of phenomena has traditional grounds. Neither laughing nor crying itself was a matter of discussion, but its motive, not the form of expression in its singularity compared to other forms of expression such as speech, gesture, and expressive movement, but its occasion. For the most part, theoretical writers have directed their attention to the question of what we laugh at and why we cry, toward the aesthetic and psychological laws of the amusing and the sad, the comic and the tragic. In their studies, laughing and crying played the role of indicators which report the course of a reaction. Their analysis is concerned with the reaction and treats the indicators only as means."
