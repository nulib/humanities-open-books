_Three Nigerian Emirates: A Study in Oral History_ is a widely held study on a scarcely examined region of Nigeria. Victor N. Low presents a detailed account of the leaders, people, and culture of the Hadejia, Katagum, and Gombe regions documented in a transcribed oral history. This work presents a valuable portrait of societies where the tradition of memory and oral history are the only means of remembering the past.
