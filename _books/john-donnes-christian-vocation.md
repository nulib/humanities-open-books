John Donne's poetry is often difficult and perplexing, even more so because it undergoes a shift away from secular topics after he converts and begins to lead a religious life. Robert S. Jackson's _John Donne's Christian Vocation_ is one of the first studies that takes seriously the ways that Donne's Christian vocation permeates all of Donne's writings, not just those after his conversion, but even those prior to it. Jackson's study remains significant today because the religion and literature movement has focused renewed attention on Donne and his writing, and numerous critics and scholars use _John Donne's Christian Vocation_ as a model for their own scholarship on Donne.
